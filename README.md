# Priconne Re:Dive text deserializer

This tool is to get the text of the story.
At least the base64...

This library is coded in pure C and
wants to be some help to other people that
wants to bakup and use the translation of
the global server.

DonÂ´t forget to see the original sources that I use
to do this thing...

1. [esterTion](https://github.com/esterTion/unity-texture-toolkit)
2. [starget](https://github.com/starjet/derestage_storydecode)

Then... Maybe with this I could do some sort of story app or something...

NOTE: I have not check if the code works correctly.
